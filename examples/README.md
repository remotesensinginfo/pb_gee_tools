# PB GEE Tools Examples

These notebooks are intended to provide documentation but also reference 
examples in how to use pb_gee_tools.


These notebooks are intended to be run within colab (https://colab.research.google.com). 
The easiest ways to run these notebooks is to download them and save them to your 
google drive and then open then in colab from there. 


To specify the region of interest for these notebooks you need to pass a file path
to a vector layer (any format than geopandas reads, such as an ESRI shapefile)
and then bounding box of all the geometries with the vector layer will be used
as the region of interest unless otherwise stated in the notebook.
